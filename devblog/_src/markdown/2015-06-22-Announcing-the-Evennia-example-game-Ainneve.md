The Evennia example-game project is underway!  
  
I was quite impressed with the response I got on the mailing list to my call for developing an Evennia example game (see my [Need your Help](http://evennia.blogspot.se/2015/06/need-your-help.html) blog post).  
  
The nature of the responses varied, many were from interested people with little to no experience in Evennia or Python whereas others had the experience but not the time to lead it. It was however clear that the interest to work on an "official" Evennia game is quite big.  
  
I'm happy to announce, however, that after only a week we now have a solid lead developer/manager, [George Oliver](https://github.com/ergodicbreak). Helping him on the technical/architecture side is [Whitenoise](https://github.com/whitenoiseoss) (who, despite a barren github profile, is a professional developer).  
  
George put together a [game proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fu-zYvFytKHGxFHD6_bLQ4FrotAQ0izXuWE_gn8q2Oc/edit) based on theÂ [OpenAdventure](http://geekguild.com/openadventure/) rpg, an open-source (CC-SA) ruleset that is also [found on github](https://github.com/openadventure/Open-Adventure). The example game is to be named "Ainneve" and its development is found in a [in a separate repository under the github Evennia organisation](https://github.com/evennia/ainneve).  
  
All the relevant links and future discussion can be found [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/evennia/rOMo5DwhXgE/0jmCpj4gITYJ).  
  
George and whitenoise have already made it clear that they aim to not only make Ainneve a good example Evennia game for others to learn from and build on, but to make the development itself a possibility for people of all skill levels to get involved. So get in touch with them if you are at all interested in Python, Evennia and mud development!  
  
So thanks to George and whitenoise for taking this on, looking forward to see where it leads!
