Optional Reality's [Dreaming Big Challenge](http://optionalrealities.com/forums/index.php?topic=13.0) has come to an end. This was a challenge about designing a "sales pitch" in 600 words or less for a text-based online roleplaying game. This is the kind of pitch you'd tease knowledgeable investors with -Â  if investors cared about multiplayer text games and you ended up in an elevator with one, that is.  
  
There were 10 entries to the competition and as the [results are now in](http://optionalrealities.com/forums/index.php?topic=101.0) (including very elaborate judge feedback!), I encourage you to go read all the entries. The focus was on originality and fresh ideas and maybe these short pitches represent a cross-section of the current trends or a whiff of where the wind is blowing for future games. Or maybe it will help inspire you to make a sales pitch of your own.
