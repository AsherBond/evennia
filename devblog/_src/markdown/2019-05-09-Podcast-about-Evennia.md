I was interviewed on the (pretty grandiosely named) podcast _Titans of Text_ the other day.  
  
In the interview, which are run by people from the [MUD Coder's Guild](https://mudcoders.com/) (a great initiative!), I talk a bit about the history of Evennia, the text-based multiplayer game engine I'm working on, and go into some various technical aspects of the engine as well. Check it out and support the podcast!
