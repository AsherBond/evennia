As of today, Evennia 0.9.5 is out. Evennia is a Python based library and framework for creating text-based multiplayer games (MUD/MU*). 

This is a gradual improvement halfway between 0.9 and the upcoming 1.0. So if you have been keeping up-to-date with the _master_ branch of Evennia over the last year you will not notice much difference from this release (time to upgrade if you haven't been keeping up though!). 

While an interim release, there are still a lot of things that has happened since v0.9: 

#### Webclient improvements  

-   Big **web client** improvements (courtesy of contributor friarzen) - players can now save and restore pane layouts directly in the client (so you could have a separate pane for channel chatter, another for look-returns, two input panes etc etc). 
-   The layout changes makes it easier for devs to create default layouts to offer to players of their game. People in the Evennia community have already started doing very cool stuff with this, I'll try to gather screenshots for a future blog.  
    
-   Allow to redirect video/music to separate panes.
-   Many other fixes, such as improving the input-history behavior.  
    

#### EvMenu improvements

**EvMenu** is a powerful system for creating in-game text menus.  

-   The **EvMenu** class was refactored to be easier to override. For example, all messages now go through **EvMenu.msg** which allows for easy customization. It also defaults to sending with a **type** of "menu", making it easier to redirect menus to seprate panes in the webclient.
-   In a node, EvMenu is now accessed via the much more logically named **.ndb._evmenu** instead of **.ndb._menutree** (the old name still works for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated).
-   New optional **EvMenu template** system for quickly building simpler EvMenus without needing so much code. This makes it easy to catch and parse arbitrary input from the user and redirect to the correct node as needed. Creating menu nodes as functions still work (and is a lot more powerful), this can be mixed with templating to create different effects.  
    

#### New settings

-   **INLINEFUNC_STACK_MAXSIZE** is an integer that allows to control how big the inlinefunc nesting stacksize is.  
    
-   New **DEFAULT_CHANNELS** setting to allow customization of which channels should be initialized on startup. This can be modified after initial server start.
-   **CHANNEL_HANDLER_CLASS** allows for specifying an alternative to the default **ChannelHandler** if wanting to change how Channels behave. 
-   **SERVER_LOG_DAY_ROTATION** defines how many days the server log should run before being force-rotated (default is seven days).
-   **SERVER_LOG_MAX_SIZE** specifies how big the log must be before it auto-rotates (even if **SERVER_LOG_DAY_ROTATION** days has not passed yet). 
-   **PORTAL_LOG_DAY_ROTATION, PORTA_LOG_MAX_SIZE** - equivalent for the Portal.  
    

####  Other improvements  

-   The **EvMore** pager saw big performance speedups, making the viewing of large numbers of entries much snappier. You can now also paginate **EvTables** directly and create custom pagers by override the **EvMore class** (useful if you want to e.g. do a EvTable per-page).  
-   Improvement to the multi-match parser: Trying to get for example **3-box** will now fail with a no-found if there are only two boxes in the room (before it would show the multi-match menu).  
-   New **inside_rec** lockfunc to recursively check if an object is inside another. Putting this on a room will thus also check the contents of any objects in the room, not only the contents themselves. Or if you had something in your wallet (a container).
-   New **$random** inlinefunc for producing a random number in strings.  
    
-   **TickerHandler.add()** now returns a **store_key** to uniquely describe the ticker just added. The **TickerHandler.remove()** accepts a new kwarg **store_key** for removing the ticker - this makes it easier to manage tickers instead having to insert the full specifications of the ticker to remove it.
-   Many fixes to the **spawn** command and prototype functionality. The new **spawn/raw** flag will now return the prototype-dict so one can manually edit and copy&paste it.
-   The **evennia.GLOBAL_SCRIPTS** container will now contain all global scripts, not only those explicitly created with the **GLOBAL_SCRIPTS** setting. 
-   The **list_to_string** utility converts a list to a nice string-representation, such as **["a", "b", "c", "d"]** -> **_"a, b, c and d"_**. The function is renamed to **iter_to_string** (but old name still works) and now also works with generators and will not crash even when provided a single value.
-   A lot of bug fixes and stability fixes!

### New documentation system 

The bigger change with 0.9.5 is that we are moving to a new documentation system. The details of the long road to do this is documented in [my previous post](). The point is that we are stopping the use of the Github wiki in favor of statically generated documentation hosted on github pages. At the same time we also move the old evennia.com website from Google-sites to Github. 

Check it out: 

-   New evennia.com: [https://evennia.com](https://evennia.com)
-   New static documentation:  [https://evennia.com/docs/latest](https://evennia.com/docs/latest)  
    

 As for the docs, they will be maturing for a long time still. The old wiki will not be updated anymore, but it will also not be going anywhere in the short term. Version 0.9.5 of the docs is pretty much a copy of the wiki and I hope to not have to spend too much more work maintaining it since the wiki is still around.  

New updates and documentation features will primarily be happening in the 1.0-dev version of the documentation. This will include refactoring all pages as well as a new intro-tutorial and many other things. 

But that's for future blogs ...
