       Getting down to the meat of extending Evennia to make our game

    Building a tech-demo and world content to go with our code

Now that we have a good idea of what we want, we need to actually implement it. In part three of the 
Starting tutorial will go through the creation of several key parts of our game. As we go, we will 
test each part and create a simple "tech demo" to show off all the moving parts.
