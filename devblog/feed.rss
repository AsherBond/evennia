        multi-player games and virtual worlds (also known as MUD, MUSH, MU,
        MUX, MUCK, etc). While Evennia handles all the necessary things every
        online game needs, like database and networking, you create the game of
        your dreams by writing normal Python modules.</description><language>en-US</language><lastBuildDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:09:02 GMT</lastBuildDate><generator>rfeed v1.1.1</generator><docs>https://github.com/svpino/rfeed/blob/master/README.md</docs><item><title> Into 2022 with thanks and plans</title><link>2022.html#2022-01-06-into-2022-with-thanks-and-plans</link><description>I didn't write an end-of-the year summary for 2021, so this first devblog of 2022 will also look back a bit at the past year.

That is, it was on Nov 20, 2006, Greg Taylor made the first repo commit to what would eventually become the Evennia of today. Greg has said that Evennia started out as a "weird experiment" of building a MUD/MUX using Django. The strange name he got from a cheesy NPC in the Guild Wars MMORPG and Greg's first post to the mailing list also echoes the experimental intention of the codebase. The merger with Twisted came pretty early too, replacing the early asyncore hack he used and immediately seeing a massive speedup. Evennia got attention from the MUD community - clearly a Python-based MUD system sounded attractive.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2016.html#2016-11-30-birthday-retrospective</guid></item><item><title>Season of fixes</title><link>2016.html#2016-10-13-season-of-fixes</link><description></description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2016.html#2016-10-13-season-of-fixes</guid></item><item><title>The art of sharing nicks and descriptions</title><link>2016.html#2016-07-01-the-art-of-sharing-nicks-and-descriptions</link><description></description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2016.html#2016-07-01-the-art-of-sharing-nicks-and-descriptions</guid></item><item><title>Evennia in Pictures</title><link>2016.html#2016-05-31-evennia-in-pictures</link><description>This article describes the MU* development system Evennia using pictures!</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2016.html#2016-05-31-evennia-in-pictures</guid></item><item><title> Evennia 0.6!</title><link>2016.html#2016-05-22-evennia-0.6!</link><description></description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2016.html#2016-05-22-evennia-0.6!</guid></item><item><title>Technical stuff happening</title><link>2016.html#2016-03-24-technical-stuff-happening</link><description>Hi folks, a bit more technical entry this time.

This update grew from one experimental feature to a relatively big update in the end. Together with the "many-character-per-player" feature released earlier, this update covers all the stuff I talked about in my Behind the Scenes blog post.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2013.html#2013-11-28-out-of-band-mergings</guid></item><item><title>A list of Evennia topics</title><link>2013.html#2013-10-22-a-list-of-evennia-topics</link><description>Some Evennia updates.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2013.html#2013-10-22-a-list-of-evennia-topics</guid></item><item><title>One to Many</title><link>2013.html#2013-05-13-one-to-many</link><description>As of yesterday, I completed and merged the first of the three upcoming Evennia features I mentioned in my Churning Behind the Scenes blog post: the "Multiple Characters per Player" feature.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2013.html#2013-05-13-one-to-many</guid></item><item><title>Churning behind the scenes</title><link>2013.html#2013-01-29-churning-behind-the-scenes</link><description>At the moment there are several Evennia projects churning along behind the scenes, none of which I've yet gotten to the point of pushing into a finished state.  Apart from bug fixes and other minor things happening, these are the main updates in the pipeline at the moment.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2013.html#2013-01-29-churning-behind-the-scenes</guid></item><item><title>Evennia changes to BSD license</title><link>2012.html#2012-10-28-evennia-changes-to-bsd-license</link><description>As of today, Evennia changes to use the very permissive BSD license.Now, our previous "Artistic License" was also very friendly. One main feature was that it made sure that changes people made to the core Evennia library (i.e. not the game-specific files) were also made available for possible inclusion upstream. A good notion perhaps, but the licensing text was also quite long and it was clear some newcomers parsed it as more restrictive than it actually was.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-10-28-evennia-changes-to-bsd-license</guid></item><item><title>Community interest</title><link>2012.html#2012-10-05-community-interest</link><description>It's fun to see a growing level of activity in the Evennia community. The last few months have seen an increase in the number of people showing up in our IRC channel and mailing list. With this has come a slew of interesting ideas, projects and MUD-related discussion (as well as a few inevitable excursions into interesting but very non-mud-related territory - sorry to those reading our chat logs).</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-10-05-community-interest</guid></item><item><title>Combining Twisted and Django</title><link>2012.html#2012-08-31-combining-twisted-and-django</link><description>Combining Twisted and Django</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-08-31-combining-twisted-and-django</guid></item><item><title>Taking command</title><link>2012.html#2012-08-16-taking-command</link><description>Commands are the bread and butter of any game. Commands are the instructions coming in from the player telling the game (or their avatar in the game) to do stuff. This post will outline the reasoning leading up to Evennia's somewhat (I think) non-standard way of handling commands.In the case of MUDs and other text games commands usually come in the form of entered text. But clicking on a graphical button or using a joystick is also at some level issuing a command - one way or another the Player instructs the game in a way it understands. In this post I will stick to text commands though. So open door with red key is a potential command.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-08-16-taking-command</guid></item><item><title>Extending time and details</title><link>2012.html#2012-06-26-extending-time-and-details</link><description>For the fun of it I added an "Extended Room" contrib to Evennia the other night.("Contribs" are optional code snippets and systems that are not part of the actual codebase.

Softcode, a defacto standard in the MUX/MUCK/MUSH/MOO world, is conceptually a "safe" in-game scripting language that allows Players to extend the functionality of things without having access to the server source.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-06-11-coding-from-the-inside</guid></item><item><title> Dummies doing (even more) dummy things</title><link>2012.html#2012-05-30-dummies-doing-(even-more)-dummy-things</link><description></description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-05-30-dummies-doing-(even-more)-dummy-things</guid></item><item><title>Shortcuts to goodness</title><link>2012.html#2012-03-26-shortcuts-to-goodness</link><description>Evennia, being a MUD-design system, needs to take some special considerations with its source code - its sole purpose is after all to be read, understood and extended.Python is of course very readable by default and we have worked hard to give extensive comments and documentation. But for a new user looking into the code for the first time, it's still a lot of stuff to take in. Evennia consists of a set of Django-style "applications" interacting and in some cases inheriting from each other so as to avoid code duplication. For a new user to get an overview could therefore mean diving into more layers of code than one would like.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-03-26-shortcuts-to-goodness</guid></item><item><title>Dummies doing dummy things</title><link>2012.html#2012-02-22-dummies-doing-dummy-things</link><description>It can often be interesting to test hypothetical situations. So the other day I did a little stress test to see how Evennia handles many players. This is a follow-up to the open bottlenecks post.Evennia, being based on Twisted, is an asynchronous mud server. This means that the program is not multi-threaded but instead it tries to divide up the code it runs into smaller parts. It then quickly switches between executing these parts in turn, giving the impression of doing many things at the same time. There is nothing magical about this - each little piece of code blocks the queue as it runs. So if a particular part takes too long, everyone else will have to wait for their turn. Likewise, if Twisted cannot flip through the queue as fast or faster than new things get added to it, it will start to fall behind.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-02-22-dummies-doing-dummy-things</guid></item><item><title>Commands and you</title><link>2012.html#2012-02-17-commands-and-you</link><description>Commands define how a Player interacts with a given game. In a text-based game it's not amiss to say that the available commands are paramount to the user experience. In principle commands could represent mouse clicks and other modernistic GUI sugar - but for this blog I'll stick with the traditional entered text.Like most things in Evennia, Commands are Python classes. If you read the documentation about them you'll find that the command classes are clumped together and tacked onto all objects in-game. Commands hanging onto a Character object will be available all the time, whereas commands tacked onto a grandfather's clock will only be available to you when you stand in front of said clock.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-02-17-commands-and-you</guid></item><item><title> Such a small thing ...</title><link>2012.html#2012-02-15-such-a-small-thing-...</link><description>Lately I went back to clean up and optimize the workings of Evennia's Attributes. I had a nice idea for making the code easier to read and also faster by caching more aggressively. The end result was of course that I managed to break things. In the end it took me two weeks to get my new scheme to a state where it did what it already did before (although faster).</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-02-15-such-a-small-thing-...</guid></item><item><title> Evennia's open bottlenecks</title><link>2012.html#2012-02-05-evennia's-open-bottlenecks</link><description>Since Evennia hit beta I have been mostly looking behind the scenes to see what can be cleaned up and not in the core server. One way to do that is to check where the bottlenecks are. Since a few commits, Evennia's runner has additions for launching the Python cProfiler at startup. This can be done for both the Portal and the Server separately.</description><author>Griatch</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">2012.html#2012-02-05-evennia's-open-bottlenecks</guid></item><item><title>About this dev blog</title><link>2012.html#2012-02-05-about-this-dev-blog</link><description>This is to be my Evennia dev blog, but it will also cover various other musings concerning programming in general and mud designing in particular.
