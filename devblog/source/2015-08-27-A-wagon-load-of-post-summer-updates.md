Summer vacations are over and work resumes in Evennia land! Here's a wagon-load of small updates on what's going on.  
   

### Ainneve

The [Ainneve project](https://github.com/evennia/ainneve), the creation of an official, open-source Evennia demo game, has gotten going. The lead devs of the project are keen to make this a collaborative effort and there is a lot of good discussion and code being written. After some slowdown at the end of summer it's bound to pick up again.   
  
Ainneve's a rare chance to see a full MUD getting developed from scratch out in the open. [The current issue list](https://github.com/evennia/ainneve/issues) includes tags for difficulty and allows also newbie Python coders to jump in. Not to mention you have a chance to get valuable feedback on your work by seasoned coders!  
  
So if you are at all interested in making a MUD, try out Python/Evennia or just get involved in a semi-big programming project, this is a great chance to do so.  
  

### Imaginary Realities

Since a few weeks, there is a new issue of [Imaginary realities](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/index.html) (vol 7, issue 3) is out. As usual I have an article in it. This venerable e-zine was revitalized to include articles on both MU* as well as roguelikes, Interactive fiction and others. Not only is this issue the most content-rich since the reboot, with this issue they have also spruced up their interface to make past issues easier to navigate.  
  

-   "[A text MUD with a working ecology system](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/a-text-mud-with-a-working-ecology-system/index.html)" - in this article Molly O'Hara  details the concepts behind simulating a functioning ecologic network in a game. Interesting stuff and some parts of this is certainly worth considering for any open-world game design. I wonder at which level of detail the system become more complex than the players can appreciate though.
-   "[Dispelling the gloom](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/dispelling-the-gloom/index.html)" by Tomasz Gruca is an interesting essay on the author's history growing up in the former Soviet Union and eventually finding text adventure games and interactive fiction, a passion he has apparently lately re-kindled. He makes the observation that the current "retro" trend of games have not really reached back to the text-based game world when it comes to mainstream acceptance.
-   "[How integral are letters and text to ASCII gaming?](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/how-integral-are-letters-and-text-to-ascii-gaming/index.html)"by Mark R. Johnson goes into the practical use of ASCII in traditional rogue-like games (beyond nostalgia). This is a meaty article that goes into both text-as-graphics as well as the use of text for aiding imagination and suggest subtle puzzles in some classic rogue-likes. 
-   ["Legend and the lore"](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/legend-and-the-lore/index.html) (Hugo Zombiestalker) proclaims the death of the traditional point-and-click adventure game and but then moves on to try to distill just why those games nevertheless was so appealing to him and how it can be applied in modern game designs like zombie-survival MUD _Epitath_ which he is a senior developer for. Plenty of good observations here!
-   "[The bonds of mudding"](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/the-bonds-of-mudding/index.html) by Clint Itan Kuranes Knapp writes about the community that can spring up on a long-running MUD, the interactions the friends and the relationships that could persist already long before "social media" became a buzz word. A warm text with plenty of anecdotes and examples and things to ponder for both designers and staff when wanting to cater for this type of player bonding. 
-   "[The mercurial temperament at the end of the world"](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/the-mercurial-temperament-at-the-end-of-the-world/index.html) (Drakkos) discusses NPCs and how they rarely are as interactive as one would want (the term "vend a chat" is a good one I think). He then goes on to how they have implemented their "Mercurial" system for NPCs in _Epitath_. This seems to be a state-AI system where NPCs have moods that affects what they say based on their circumstance and relation to other actors in the world. Sounds really cool and since he goes into some details on the implementation there is a lot to ponder here. 
-   "[Where do I begin?](http://journal.imaginary-realities.com/volume-07/issue-03/where-do-i-begin/index.html)" by me, Griatch, discusses one of the more common questions we get in the Evennia chat - 'I want to make a MUD, but how do I begin?' This article starts before Evennia's Game planning wiki page - it discusses assessing your capabilities and resources in the form of programming skills, code bases and motivations to help you figure out what you can realistically accomplish. 

### Evennia Web client

In the pipeline I have some updates to Evennia's websocket/JSON MUD-web client component. These are changes that are intended to make the webclient easier to customize and hook into Evennia output using only HTML/CSS. More details on this will be forthcoming when I have more solid stuff to show.
