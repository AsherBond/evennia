<p><em>Evennia</em> is an open-source Python-based MUD/MU* server/codebase using modern technologies. Evennia allows creators to design and flesh out text-based massively-multiplayer online games with great freedom.</p>

<h2>
<a name="features-and-philosophy" class="anchor"
  href="#features-and-philosophy"><span class="octicon
    octicon-link"></span></a>Features and Philosophy</h2>

<p>Evennia aims to supply a bare-bones MU* codebase that allows vast
flexibility for game designers while taking care of all the gritty networking
and database-handling behind the scenes. Evennia offers an easy API for
handling persistent objects, time-dependent scripting and all the other
low-level features needed to create a MU*. The idea is to allow the mud-coder
to concentrate solely on designing the parts and systems of the mud that makes
it uniquely fit their ideas.</p>

<p>Coding in Evennia is primarily done by normal Python modules, making the
codebase extremely flexible. The code is heavily documented and you use Python
classes to represent your objects, scripts and players. The database layer is
abstracted away.</p>

<p>Evennia offers extensive connectivity options. A single server instance may
offer connections over Telnet, SSH, SSL and HTTP. The latter is possible since
Evennia is also its own web server: A default website as well as a
browser-based comet-style mud client comes as part of the package (<a
href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Screenshot">screenshot</a>). Due
to our Django and Twisted foundations, web integration is a snap since the same
code that powers the game may also be used to run its web presence (you may use
a third-party webserver too if you prefer though). Evennia in-game channels can
also be interlinked with external IRC and IMC2 channels so players can chat
with people "outside" the game.</p>

<p>Whereas Evennia is intended to be customized to almost any level you like,
we do offer some defaults you can build from. The code base comes with basic
classes for objects, exits, rooms and characters. There is also a default
command set for handling administration, building, chat channels, poses and so
on. This is enough to run a 'Talker' or some other social-style game out of the
box. Stock Evennia is however deliberately void of any game-world-specific
systems. So you won't find any AI codes, mobs, skill systems, races or combat
stats in the default distribution (we might expand our contributions folder
with optional plugins in the future though).</p>

<p>If this piqued your interest, there is also a <a
  href="docs/latest/Evennia-Introduction.html">lengthier
  introduction</a> to Evennia to read.</p>

<h2>
<a name="current-status" class="anchor" href="#current-status"><span
    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Status</h2>

<p>The codebase is currently in <strong>Beta</strong>. While development
continues, Evennia is already stable enough to be suitable for prototyping and
development of your own games.</p>
