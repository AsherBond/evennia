Evennia, the Python MUD/MUSH/MU* creation library participates in the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) 2017 (sign up on that page)! Hacktoberfest is open for all open-source projects like ours. After registering, if you make at least **four** Pull Requests to a public repo on Github during October (need not just be to Evennia), you win a limited-edition T-shirt!  
  
The help Evennia out and get your T-Shirt, look at our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues). I have marked some issues with "Hacktoberfest" but you could take on any issue you want. Take a look in particular at the [Unit test issue](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/issues/1458) if you are looking to get into contributing on a smaller scale while helping us tremendously.  
  
If you have any questions on contributing (or it's your first time making a Pull Request), don't be shy to drop into #evennia on irc.freenode.net or ask in our [forum/mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/evennia). Have fun!
