<p><em>Evennia</em> is an open-source Python-based framework, codebase and
server for creating text-based multiplayer online games (a MUD/MU* etc) using modern
technologies and tools.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor"
  href="#installation"><span class="octicon
    octicon-link"></span></a>Live demo</h2>

<img class="img floatright" src="images/book.png" alt="Book">
<p>
<a href="https://demo.evennia.com">https://demo.evennia.com</a> sports an
almost vanilla install of a default Evennia server. It has the tutorial world
and a few extra thing to experience and try out. Use it to get a taste for
what's possible. You can also ask questions in our support channel directly
from inside the demo!</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor"
  href="#installation"><span class="octicon
    octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

Evennia is installed by cloning and installing its repo from 
<a href="https://github.com/evennia/evennia">github</a>. The 
<a href="docs/latest/Getting-Started.html">Getting Started</a> instructions will 
help you get things set up. Once installed, creating your new game is quick:

<div class="codeblock">
  <code>
    evennia --init mygame<br>
    cd mygame<br>
    evennia start
  </code>
</div>

You can now browse your new game's website and play locally in your browser at 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:4001">http://localhost:4001</a>. You can also 
connect to it with a traditional third-party MUD client on <code>localhost, port 4000</code>.

<h2><a name="overview" class="anchor"
  href="#overview"><span class="octicon
    octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<img class="img floatleft" src="images/inkwell.png" alt="Inkwell">

<p>Evennia aims to take care of all the gritty networking, database-handling
and other boring details that all MU*s games need. The idea is to allow you,
the game developer, to concentrate solely on designing the game systems. We try
to get out of your way as much as possible.</p>

<p>Evennia is game-agnostic. So we have no opinions on what style of play or
genre of game you should make. We don't prescribe any skills, classes, races or
other things that will be specific for your game anyway. Indeed, people have
used Evennia for non-MU*s as well - it's very suitable for wild experimenting
and fast prototyping!</p>

<p>Some game concepts and systems are more common than others though. For these
we offer a growing library of optional code-snippets and bigger game systems
you can build from, copy or be inspired by. These are mostly contributed by our
very friendly developer community.</p> 

<p>Finally, we have tried to make Evennia's code as readable and
well-documented as possible, should you need to dive in. We have also 
spent a lot of time on our <a href="docs/latest/index.html">extensive documentation</a>,
all in order to to help you get productive in Evennia with less fuss.</p>


<h2><a name="default-content" class="anchor"
  href="#default-content"><span class="octicon
    octicon-link"></span></a>Default Content</h2>

<p>Whereas your Evennia game starts out with no game-specific content, it's not
empty! Out of the box you get a 'talker'-style game: You can create rooms and
items, pick up stuff, talk to people, walk around, do light roleplay with
emotes ... all the base things you expect.</p>

<p>Here are some of the default resources and tools available out of the box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classes for persistent objects, exits, rooms and characters.</li>
  <li>Separation between character and their accounts (multi-character play, if desired)</li>
  <li>In-game channels and chats (including linking to external chat channels)
  <li>About 90 commands for administration, building, chatting, basic roleplay etc</li>
  <li>Available commands and even their function can vary with circumstance and game state</li>
  <li>Delays, tickers, timers (fully asynchronous, no threading so no risk of race conditions)</li>
  <li>In-game menu-creation system</li>
  <li>Prototype system, for making variations of objects (like monsters or items) without new classes</li>
  <li>Lock and access mini-language for very flexible access control</li>
  <li>Tutorial-world with examples</li>
  <li>Easy storage of custom data on all game objects</li>
  <li>Search, creation, and a large number of coding utilities</li>
  <li>A <code>contrib/</code> folder with optional full systems and shorter snippets</li>
</ul>

<img class="img floatright" src="images/dice.png" alt="Dice">

<p>Coding in Evennia is primarily done by normal Python modules, making the
codebase extremely flexible - you don't tweak the library itself, you just
override the defaults and tell Evennia where to find your changes.</p>

<p>You use Python classes to represent your objects,
scripts and players. The database layer is mostly abstracted away but if you
want you can also leverage the full power of Django's mature ORM.</p>
